-[Exploring functionality with wireframes](https://medium.com/@aajularsen/a-side-project-as-part-of-your-portfolio-designing-as-a-programmer-e4abaa3cb9f6#.3krw3qi3h)

It's created using 'create-react-app'
Furthermore it uses:
- redux
- axios
- mongo
- express
- material ui (planned)

For linting purposes and general code quality I'm using:
- eslint (AirBnB styleguide)
- flow

To run the project:
- Clone it
- `npm install`
- `npm run start-dev` to start the server and the frontend
- `yarn` is usable too if you'd prefer.
